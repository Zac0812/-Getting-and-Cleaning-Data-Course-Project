# Preview

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

The data<a href = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"> Linked </a> represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities:

- WALKING, 
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
-SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING 

Wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured **3-axial linear acceleration** and **3-axial angular velocity** at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where:

1. 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 
2. 30% the test data. 

# Target

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis, we will submit:

1. A tidy data set
2. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
3. A README.md file.
4. a Repo in GitHub.
